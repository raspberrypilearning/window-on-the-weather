## What you will make
In this resource, you will use Scratch to communicate with OpenWeatherMap and get weather data for any city in the world. You can then use this data to create a visualisation of the weather in that city.


## What you will learn
By creating a Window On The Weather program with your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

- How to connect Scratch to a weather API
- How to use sensor values in Scratch
- How to visualise weather conditions graphically

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Design basic 2D and 3D assets](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/design/creator)
- [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)
