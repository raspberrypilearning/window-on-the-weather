## A little help from Python

Scratch 1.4 isn't able to communicate over the internet on its own, so you're going to need a little Python script to help Scratch communicate with the OpenWeatherMap API.

-  Open Scratch (`Menu` > `Programming` > `Scratch`).

-  Click on 'Sensing':

-  Then if you right-click on the `slider sensor value` block, you can select `enable remote sensor connections` from the context menu that appears.

-  It's probably a good idea to save this file now. Call it `magic-window`.

-  With Scratch all set up, you can now download [this script](resources/weather.py).

-  You can run this script by opening a terminal and typing:

    ``` python
    python3 weather.py
    ```

    or you could open the file using *IDLE* and then press `F5` to run it.

-  You must make sure this script is running, or your Scratch program won't work. Every time you want to use your Scratch program, you'll need to run this script first.
