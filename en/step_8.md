## Bring me sunshine

-  A good way to indicate the temperature might be the size of the sun that can be seen outside the window.
-  First, you need to find a nice picture of the sun. You can find your own if you like, or use the one below:

-  Click on the button to import a new `Sprite`:

-  Now import your `sun` image. Position your sun near the top of your screen.

-  You now need to use the temperature to size the sun. You may wish to play with the values, depending on the size of your sun sprite. In the example below, the sun is sized to the `temperature + 60`. The whole thing is placed in a `forever` loop so that every time you change the city, the temperature is updated.
