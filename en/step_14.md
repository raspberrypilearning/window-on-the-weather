## What next?

There's lots you could do with this project:

-   Why not try and add in some physical computing, using LEDs to indicate if it's raining or not?
-   Maybe you could change the backdrop in Scratch so that it matches the country or city that is being requested.
-   You could try and investigate the Python script, and see what other weather data is available.
